/*A correspondent banking relationship involves one financial institution (the correspondent) providing banking services to another financial institution (the respondent), where the financial institutions carry on activities or business at or through permanent establishments in different countries.

Typically, in a correspondent banking relation, two banks in two different countries enter into an agreement to open a correspondent account (Nostro or Vostro account), which enables a domestic bank to make payments or do money transfers in local currency on behalf of a foreign bank.*/
