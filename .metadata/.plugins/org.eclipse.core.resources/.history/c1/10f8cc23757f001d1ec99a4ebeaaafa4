/*A measuring state on which movements in value or amounts of assets, rights and obligations are registered.

Comment: 
It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.
The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,
Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.
A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 â‚¬ in cash, there is
a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased)
an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased)

An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...
