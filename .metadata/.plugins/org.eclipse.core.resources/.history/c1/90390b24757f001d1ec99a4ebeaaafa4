/*An arrangement within the investment Portfolio Management Agreement like:
- Advisory Arrangement: give or not to give the advice before to do something 
- Investment Strategy Arrangement: Defensive vs  Offensive. Defensive investment strategies are designed to deliver protection first and modest growth second. With an offensive or aggressive investment strategy, by contrast, an investor tries to take advantage of a rising market by purchasing securities that are outperforming for a given level of risk and volatility.
