/*An exposed function (an externalized functionality) that is able to deliver a certain value/benefit (a proposed definition adapted from Archimate).

A unit of functionality that a system exposes to its environment, while hiding internal operations, which provides a certain value (monetary or otherwise). 


Comment:

A Service is something that is done by an actor for the benefit of an actor in the environment.

A system is the broad sense of the word. Means Business Service, Application Service, Technology Service, "huppeldepup" Service
 


Characteristics of a service:

A system (The Service Domain)
Functionality is exposed (Action Term)
It provides a certain value (monetary or otherwise) 


Exposing functionality means that the internals of realizing the service is hidden for the beneficiary of the Service.
 


In BIAN a "Service Operation" is visualized as a "Business Service" , the "System" refers to the  "Service Domain"  

The name of a Service Operation is composed of an "Action Term" + "Subject Matter" which is the "Control Record" or the "Behaviour Qualifier".


Service is the intangible equivalent of a good. (ISO20022). 

A type of economic activity that is intangible, is not stored and does not result in ownership; a service is consumed at the point of sale (FIBO & Business Dictionary)*/
