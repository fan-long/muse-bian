A regulatory body is a public organization or government agency that is set up to exercise a regulatory function. This involves imposing requirements, conditions or restrictions, setting the standard for activities, and enforcing in these areas or obtaining compliance. Regulatory bodies cover a wide variety of professions, but not all professions are regulated and may be self-regulated. A regulatory body might also be referred to as a regulatory agency, a regulatory authority or a regulator.
