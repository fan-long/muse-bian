/*An arrangement for placing a lien against the account

An arrangement that grants a creditor the right to use an asset as a guarantee for an underlying obligation. 

A lien is a legal right granted by the owner of property, by a law or otherwise acquired by a creditor. A lien serves to guarantee an underlying obligation, such as the repayment of a loan. If the underlying obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may be able to seize the asset that is the subject of the lien. (Investopedia)

A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on the debtor's (borrower's) property. The lien is recorded at a government's office. The lien provides a creditor with some protection or collateral until the debtor pays the creditor the amount owed. (Accounting Coach)

A legal claim against an asset which is used to secure a loan and which must be paid when the property is sold. Liens can be structured in many different ways. In some cases, the creditor will have legal claim against an asset, but not actually hold it in possession, while in other cases the creditor will actually hold on to the asset until the debt is paid off. The former is a more common arrangement when the asset is productive, since the creditor would prefer that the asset be used to produce a stream of income to pay off debt rather than just held in possession and not used. A claim can hold against an asset until all the obligations to the creditor are cleared (a general lien), or just until the obligations against that particular assets are cleared (a particular lien). (Investorword)

Difference between Lien and Collateral? The Lien is the agreement, the Collateral is the asset. So, a collateral agreement and a lien are synonyms. see also https://efinancemanagement.com/sources-of-finance/pledge-vs-hypothecation-vs-lien-vs-mortgage-vs-assignment
