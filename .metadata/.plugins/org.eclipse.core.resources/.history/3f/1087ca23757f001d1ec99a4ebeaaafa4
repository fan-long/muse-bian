/*An account that holds the position (balance) of issued invoices that are not yet paid.

Description:
Accounts receivable (AR) is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. (investopedia)
Accounts receivable is an asset account on the balance sheet that represents money due to a company in the short-term. 
Accounts receivables are created when a company lets a buyer purchase their goods or services on credit.
Accounts payable is similar to accounts receivable, but instead of money to be received, its money owed.  (investopedia)*/
