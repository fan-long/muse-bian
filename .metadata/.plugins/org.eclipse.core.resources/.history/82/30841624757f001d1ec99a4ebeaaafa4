The addition of all the positions per product results in one net position (due or to receive) with the clearing house or the central clearing counterparty. (ISO20022)

The process of transmitting, reconciling and, in some cases, confirming transactions prior to settlement, potentially including the netting of transactions and the establishment of final positions for settlement. Sometimes this term is also used (imprecisely) to cover settlement. For the clearing of futures and options, this term also refers to the daily balancing of profits and losses and the daily calculation of collateral
requirements ( Bank for International Settlements Glossary)
