Bank Guarantee vs Letter of Credit 

- A bank guarantee is a promise from a lending institution that ensures the bank will step up if a debtor can't cover a debt.

- Letters of credit are also financial promises on behalf of one party in a transaction and are especially significant in international trade.

Letter of credit is an financial document for assured payments, i.e. an undertaking of the buyer's bank to make payment to seller, against the documents stated. A bank guarantee is a guarantee given by the bank to the beneficiary on behalf of the applicant, to effect payment, if the applicant defaults in payment.*/
