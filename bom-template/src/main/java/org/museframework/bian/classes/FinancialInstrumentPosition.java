/*The position of a financial instrument


What is a Position?
A position is the amount of a security, commodity or currency which is owned by an individual, dealer, institution, or other fiscal entity. They come in two types: short positions, which are borrowed and then sold, and long positions, which are owned and then sold. Depending on market trends, movements and fluctuations, a position can be profitable or unprofitable. Restating the value of a position to reflect its actual current value on the open market is referred to in the industry as mark-to-market. (Investopedia)
