/*A delinquent account is a credit account on which a consumer has failed to make at least the minimum monthly payment by the due date.

In everyday use, any account past due is a delinquent account. But in the credit card industry, a card issuer usually will not report an account as delinquent until at least 30 days have gone past the due date during which the cardholder has not made at least a minimum payment.
