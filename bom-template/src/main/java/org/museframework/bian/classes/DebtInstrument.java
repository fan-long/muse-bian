What is the difference between debt instruments and equity instruments?

Debt instruments are assets that require a fixed payment to the holder, usually with interest. Examples of debt instruments include bonds (government or corporate) and mortgages.
Equity instruments allow a company to raise money without incurring debt. This can include selling stock. When equity instruments are used, the holders give money in exchange for a portion of the company.
Debt holders usually charge businesses interest, while equity holders rely on stock appreciation or dividends for a return.*/
