/*Financial instruments representing a sum of rights of the investor vis-a-vis the issuer. (ISO20022)

There are primarily three types of securities: equity - which provide ownership rights to holders, debt - which are essentially loans that are repaid with periodic payments, and hybrid - which combine aspects of debt and equity.
